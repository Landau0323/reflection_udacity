How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Diff shows only the parts which have difference, and does not show the all parts of the code. This is not convenient to catch the overall feature.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It enables us to understand which part was edited at which stage.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: You can choose logically correct timing of saving new version.
    Cons: You can forget saving new version.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because it is more convenient when the multiple files are closely connected.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    1. git log
    2. git diff first_commit_id second_commit_id

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    git version control system is excellent!

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For my job.
